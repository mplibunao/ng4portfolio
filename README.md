# Portfolio

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.1.

Redid my portfolio using the new things I learned in web development:

- Angular 4
- SASS
- Grunt
- Minification (Webpack does it out of the box but I did it for practice anyway)
- Responsive design and performance optimization
  - Media Queries
  - Image Compression
  - Picture
  - Creating and using webp if the browser supports it
- No bootstrap, trying to flex my css muscles :)
